# QuoteBot_app

A Clojure application to send quotes to twitter once in a while.

This is a prototype.  If I ever use this bot for something that gets
a reasonable number of followers, I'll start working on it again.

## Usage

$ lein run # :)

You'll need to update the quote list, create a credentials file and point the
code at it, and then run the app.
